# Orange-HRM-Automation-Project
Automated testing project for Orange HRM using Selenium WebDriver with C# in Visual Studio 2019. Follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and includes 36 test cases covering core HR features like login, admin, employee, and leave management.

The website I have chosen to test is Orange HRM (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) .It’s basically an HR – management system that manages HR System for small, medium, large size business. It is an open source platform.

 Use Selenium Framework:
                                  Selenium could run test ware directly on the target browser, drive the interaction on the required website and return them without any manual input.
I have written a total of ‘36’ test cases by using Selenium in C-Sharp language using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019

Page Object model Approach 
	Basically it is object Design pattern in selenium which creates an object repository to store all web elements, which reduce Duplication in code and increase maintenance.
We suppose each web page as individual class file, each class consist of corresponding web page element.
